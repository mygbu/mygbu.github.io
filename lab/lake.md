#Q. The rate of change of the comcentration of pollution in a lake is equal to the difference between the concentration of polluted water entering the lake and that leaving the lake. Assume that water containg a constant concentartion of C kg/km^3 of pollutants enters the lake at the rate of 150 km^3/year, and water leavesthe lake at the same rate. Also assume that the volume of the lake remains constant at 5000 km^3.
#a. Formulate a mathematical model to represent the rate of change of concentration of pollution in the lake. Find the mathematical solution.
#b. If the initial concentration of pollution is 40kg/km^3. Find the particular solution for the problem.
#c. The fastest possible cleanup of the lake will occur if all pollution inflow ceases. This is represented by C=0. If all pollution into the lake was stopped immediately, how long would it take to reduce pollution to 50% of its current value.
#d. Use the computer to graph your solution for the first 100 years after pollution stops. What happens to the concentration as time goes on.
